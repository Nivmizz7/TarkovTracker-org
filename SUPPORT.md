# Support Resources

Thanks for your interest in TarkovTracker! We want to make it easy to find answers and get help when you need it.

## Self-service resources

- **Documentation** – Start with the [README](README.md) for an overview and check the [`docs/`](docs/) directory for API references.
- **Changelog** – Review [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) to see what has changed between releases.
- **Discussions** – Browse [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/TarkovTracker/tarkovtracker/discussions) for community Q&A, feature ideas, and announcements.

## Ask the community

- Join the [TarkovTracker Discord](https://discord.gg/zeAP4Ng) for live chat, play sessions, and quick feedback loops.
- Create a new discussion under the `Q&A` or `Ideas` categories.
- Join informal playtests or co-working sessions announced in the `Events` category.
- Share tips, builds, or third-party integrations that other players might find helpful.

## Report a bug

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/TarkovTracker/tarkovtracker/issues) to avoid duplicates.
- If no issue exists, open a new one and include reproduction steps, screenshots, browser/OS versions, and any relevant logs.
- Clearly label the issue (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`) to help maintainers triage quickly.
