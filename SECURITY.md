# Security Policy

We take the security of TarkovTracker seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure from the community.

## Supported versions
Security fixes are developed against the `main` branch and released as soon as practical. Older tags may not receive patches unless otherwise announced.

## Reporting a vulnerability
- **Do not** file a public GitHub issue for security problems.
- Email the maintainers at [security@tarkovtracker.org](mailto:security@tarkovtracker.org) with the following details:
  - Description of the vulnerability and potential impact
  - Steps to reproduce or proof of concept
  - Any known mitigations or workarounds
- Encrypt communications if you prefer PGPâ€”contact us to request a public key.

You will receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours. We aim to provide an initial assessment and mitigation plan within 7 days.

## Coordinated disclosure process
1. The maintainers will confirm the issue and assess severity.
2. A fix will be developed privately. We may reach out for additional information or verification.
3. Once a patch is ready, we will coordinate a release and publish an advisory in the repository.
4. Public disclosure happens after users have had a reasonable opportunity to update, unless there is an active exploitation requiring immediate notice.

Thank you for helping us keep the TarkovTracker community safe!
