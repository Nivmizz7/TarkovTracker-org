# TarkovTracker

A community-maintained web application for planning and tracking your Escape From Tarkov progression. TarkovTracker keeps tabs on tasks, hideout upgrades, and required items so you can focus on raids while sharing progress with your squad.

> **Project Status**
> This repository is a community fork of the original [TarkovTracker project](https://github.com/TarkovTracker/TarkovTracker). The official production instance continues to live at <https://tarkovtracker.io> and this fork is developed and hosted by volunteers at <https://tarkovtracker.org> while the original maintainer is inactive. If the original owner returns, stewardship will gladly be transferred back.

- Collaborate with friends using the built-in team system backed by Firebase
- Enjoy offline-ready functionality thanks to local storage and PWA support
- Benefit from an open API and generated documentation for integrations

## Architecture overview
TarkovTracker is built as a modern Jamstack-style application:

- **Frontend** – A Vue 3 + Vite single-page application (SPA) with TypeScript, Pinia for state management, and Vuetify for UI.
- **Backend** – Firebase Cloud Functions provide team syncing, authentication, and access to external services when needed.
- **Data** – Firestore rules, indexes, and emulators are versioned in this repository for reproducible environments.
- **Tooling** – The monorepo is managed with npm workspaces. Linting, formatting, and TypeScript support are configured via ESLint, Prettier, and shared configs.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or newer (installs npm automatically)
- [Java 11+ Runtime Environment](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure) (required for Firebase emulators)
- Optional: [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) if you prefer to manage emulators separately

### Quick start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TarkovTracker/tarkovtracker.git
cd tarkovtracker

# Install dependencies for all workspaces
npm install

# Run the frontend and Firebase emulators together
npm run dev
```
The application will start a Vite development server (default `http://localhost:5173`) alongside local Firebase emulators.

### Available scripts
The root `package.json` exposes helpful scripts for daily development:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Starts the frontend dev server and Firebase emulators concurrently. |
| `npm run build` | Builds the Vue frontend (`frontend/dist`) and Firebase Functions bundle. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint across the monorepo. |
| `npm run format` | Formats the codebase using Prettier. |
| `npm run docs` | Generates the OpenAPI spec and Swagger UI assets in the `docs/` directory. |
| `npm run emulators` | Builds functions and launches the Firebase Emulator Suite. |
