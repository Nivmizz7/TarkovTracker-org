# Firebase Configuration for Local Development
# 
# IMPORTANT: For local development with full Firebase Functions support,
# you MUST use your real Firebase project credentials instead of demo-project.
# 
# The demo-project has CORS limitations that prevent Firebase Functions from working properly.
# Using your real project with emulators gives you the best local development experience.
#
# To set up local development:
# 1. Copy this file to .env.local
# 2. Replace the values below with your actual Firebase project credentials
# 3. The app will automatically connect to local emulators when running on localhost
# 4. Your data will be stored locally in emulator, not in production Firebase
#
# You can find these credentials in Firebase Console > Project Settings > General > Your apps

# Replace with your actual Firebase project credentials:
