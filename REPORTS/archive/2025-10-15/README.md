# Archived Reports - October 15, 2025

## Reason for Archival

These reports were generated on October 14-15, 2025, but contained significant inaccuracies due to rapid development progress. Many of the issues they identified had already been resolved:

**Outdated Information:**

- TaskList.vue reported as 1,168 lines → Actually 127 lines (already fixed)
- progress.ts reported as 619 lines → Actually 200 lines (already fixed)
- Firebase imports reported as needing migration → Already using modular imports
- Task filtering reported as needed → Already implemented

**Overlap Issues:**

- Multiple reports covered the same items (e.g., index.ts mentioned in 5 reports)
- P0 items duplicated across 3 meta-reports
- Confusing hierarchy with overlapping scopes

## Archived Files

1. **REPORTS_VERIFICATION_STATUS.md** - Meta-report tracking outstanding work
2. **COMPREHENSIVE_REVIEW_REPORT.md** - Outstanding actions summary
3. **PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md** - Performance issues (mostly resolved)

## Current Documentation

See the active reports in `/REPORTS/`:

- `ACTION_ITEMS.md` - Current work items (verified accurate)
- `ARCHITECTURE_REVIEW.md` - System architecture (will be updated)
- `DEPENDENCY_UPGRADE_STRATEGY.md` - Still valid for future upgrades
- `DEPENDENCY_UPGRADE_QUICK_START.md` - Quick reference guide
- `DEPENDENCY_INTEGRATION_MAP.md` - Technical reference
- `LEGACY_MODERNIZATION_REPORT.md` - Pattern guidance (still useful)

## Historical Context

These reports documented the state of the codebase before the major refactoring effort that:

- Decomposed large components (TaskList, progress store)
- Completed Firebase modular migration
- Implemented task filtering features

They remain valuable as historical records showing the evolution of the codebase.
